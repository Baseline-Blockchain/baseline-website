Baseline Cash is a straightforward, open payment network designed for simplicity and fairness. It strips away the complexity of modern "crypto platforms" to focus on one thing: **moving value reliably**.

- **CPU/GPU Mining**: Reference miners support CPUs and GPUs on SHA256d.
- **No Gatekeepers**: Anyone can run a node or a pool.
- **No Signup**: Just generate a wallet and go.

## Why Baseline?

We built Baseline to return to the roots of peer-to-peer cash, but with modern operational improvements.

### 1. Accessible Mining Tooling
Baseline ships with open-source CPU/GPU miners and built-in pool support, so you can start mining or run a community pool without extra infrastructure.

### 2. Built-in Pools
Running a mining pool usually requires complex custom software. In Baseline, **every node is a pool**. You can spin up a node and let your friends mine to it immediately. Payouts are handled automatically by the protocol.
