Baseline Cash is a straightforward, open payment network designed for simplicity and fairness. It strips away the complexity of modern "crypto platforms" to focus on one thing: **moving value reliably**.

- **No ASICs**: Mine with your existing CPU or GPU.
- **No Gatekeepers**: Anyone can run a node or a pool.
- **No Signup**: Just generate a wallet and go.

## Why Baseline?

We built Baseline to return to the roots of peer-to-peer cash, but with modern operational improvements.

### 1. Fair Mining for Everyone
Unlike Bitcoin, where you need million-dollar warehouses of specialized hardware (ASICs) to compete, Baseline uses a modified proof-of-work algorithm. This means the gaming PC or workstation you already own is a first-class citizen on the network.

### 2. Built-in Pools
Running a mining pool usually requires complex custom software. In Baseline, **every node is a pool**. You can spin up a node and let your friends mine to it immediately. Payouts are handled automatically by the protocol.

### 3. Scheduled Payments
Baseline supports **verifiable future payments**. You can lock funds to be sent at a specific future date. This is built directly into the chain, allowing you to set up trustless deferred transfers.
